**UID Cookie Box**

This box stands in the Ume√• Institute of Design in Sweden and feeds cookies to all who tweet the correct hashtag.

This project was originally a 2-day student sprint to make an object that talks
with the Internet.
Original node Twitter code from https://github.com/chovy/nodejs-stream.

Feel free to use this code for any Twitter-triggered Arduino activity

Here are some crude steps to get started:
-Firmata Standard on your Arduino
-Breakout.js(http://breakoutjs.com/) running
-run app.js from node[node app.js]
-visit localhost:8080 from your computer (or just visit the node server you launched)

js/twitter.js manages data handling from the node server
js/servo.js is where all the commands get sent to Breakout/Arduino
